## ðŸ”® AI Trends in 2025

Artificial Intelligence has continued to evolve rapidly in 2025, with several key trends dominating the landscape:

### 1. **AI Assistants Become Ubiquitous**
From personal productivity to enterprise automation, AI assistants are now deeply integrated into daily life. The ability to understand natural language and perform complex tasks has significantly improved.

### 2. **Multimodal AI**
AI models can now understand and generate text, images, audio, and even video simultaneously. This allows for more seamless and human-like interactions in apps, websites, and devices.

### 3. **AI and Regulation**
Governments around the world are implementing stricter AI regulations. Transparency, data provenance, and ethical use of generative AI are now required in many jurisdictions.

## ðŸ¤– Predictions for the Future

Here are some predictions for how AI might develop by the end of the decade:

- **AI as a Co-creator**: AI will be more involved in creative fieldsâ€”music, writing, art, even game design.
- **Federated Learning at Scale**: Privacy-preserving models will become the norm, with data staying on-device.
- **Human-AI Collaboration**: Teams will regularly include AI collaborators that contribute ideas, code, or even strategy.

## Code Example: Tabs vs. Spaces

Here's a classic debate in software development, now with AI taking sides too:

```js
// Tab-indented
function greet() {
	console.log("Hello, world!");
}

// Space-indented
function farewell() {
  console.log("Goodbye, world!");
}
````

Which one do you prefer? Tabs or spaces? Let the flame war begin.
